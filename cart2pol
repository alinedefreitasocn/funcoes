"""CART2POL Transform Cartesian to polar coordinates.
    [TH,R] = CART2POL(X,Y) transforms corresponding elements of data
    stored in Cartesian coordinates X,Y to polar coordinates (angle TH
    and radius R).  The arrays X and Y must be the same size (or
    either can be scalar). TH is returned in radians. 
 
    [TH,R,Z] = CART2POL(X,Y,Z) transforms corresponding elements of
    data stored in Cartesian coordinates X,Y,Z to cylindrical
    coordinates (angle TH, radius R, and height Z).  The arrays X,Y,
    and Z must be the same size (or any of them can be scalar).  TH is
    returned in radians."""
